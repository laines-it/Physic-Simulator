__This simulator was made as Task2 for MSU C++ seminars__
```console
make
bin/main <seed> <lights> <heavys>
```
where `seed` for random, `lights` and `heavys` are numbers of light and heavy particles.

For example, the line `bin/main 228 3 5` gives this:

Color of a particle displays its mass.
*a darker color corresponds to a larger mass*

There could be shitty stuff in console while the simulation is running, don't pay attention.

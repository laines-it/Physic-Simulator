       fltk - the fast light tool kit


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       The  Fast  Light  Tool Kit ("FLTK") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit
       for UNIX(r)/Linux(r) (X11 and Wayland),  Microsoft(r)  Windows(r),  and
       macOS(r).   FLTK  provides  modern  GUI functionality without bloat and
       supports 3D graphics via OpenGL(r) and its built-in GLUT emulation.  It
       was originally developed by Mr. Bill Spitzak  and  is  currently  main‚Äê
       tained  by  a small group of developers across the world with a central
       repository on GitHub.

       FLTK is provided under the terms of the GNU Library General Public  Li‚Äê
       cense, with the following exceptions:

              1.  Modifications  to  the  FLTK configure script, config header
              file, and makefiles by themselves to support a specific platform
              do not constitute a modified or derivative work.

              The authors do request that such modifications be contributed to
              the FLTK project - send all contributions through the  "Software
              Trouble Report" on the following page:

                  https://www.fltk.org/bugs.php

              2.  Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not consti‚Äê
              tute a derivative work.

              3. Static linking of applications and widgets to  the  FLTK  li‚Äê
              brary does not constitute a derivative work and does not require
              the author to provide source code for the application or widget,
              use  the  shared  FLTK  libraries, or link their applications or
              widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.

              If you link the application or widget to a modified  version  of
              FLTK,  then the changes to FLTK must be provided under the terms
              of the LGPL in sections 1, 2, and 4.

              4. You do not have to provide a copy of the  FLTK  license  with
              programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor do you have to
              identify  the  FLTK  license in your program or documentation as
              required by section 6 of the LGPL.

              However, programs must still identify their  use  of  FLTK.  The
              following  example  statement can be included in user documenta‚Äê
              tion to satisfy this requirement:

              [program/widget] is based in  part  on  the  work  of  the  FLTK
              project (https://www.fltk.org).
